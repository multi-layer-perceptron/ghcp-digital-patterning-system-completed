# Copilot Instructions

This repository is a workshop project for an elevator dispatch simulation. Keep generated application code under the top-level `workspace/` directory unless the user explicitly asks to change repository-level docs, prompt files, or configuration.

## Project Shape

- Treat `workspace/` as the application root.
- The backend is a Python 3.10+ FastAPI app in `workspace/api/`.
- The simulation domain model lives in `workspace/simulation/`.
- Browser UI files live in `workspace/ui/`; `workspace/ui/templates/index.html` serves the page and `workspace/ui/static/` contains served assets.
- Tests live in `workspace/tests/` and use the Python standard library `unittest` framework.
- Reusable workshop prompts live in `.github/prompts/`, and task-specific implementation guidance lives in `.github/skills/`.
- Keep repository-level lab assets, PRDs, prompts, skills, and setup files outside `workspace/` unless the requested
  change is application code.

## Architecture Guidelines

- Keep live simulation state in memory. PostgreSQL support is optional and should only persist run metadata and passenger
  events when `DATABASE_URL` is configured.
- Do not add authentication, queues, external services, or mandatory persistent storage unless the user asks.
- Preserve the educational starter-project style: small modules, clear names, explicit state transitions, and simple heuristics that are easy to explain in a workshop.
- Keep dispatch behavior isolated in `workspace/simulation/dispatcher.py` and simulation tick/lifecycle behavior in `workspace/simulation/simulation.py`.
- Keep API request validation in `workspace/api/server.py` using Pydantic models and FastAPI route handlers.
- Maintain the 5-floor, 4-elevator default scenario unless a prompt explicitly changes those requirements.
- Use straightforward scheduling heuristics; do not introduce ML or optimization libraries for dispatch logic.
- When a prompt references a repository skill, read and follow that skill's `SKILL.md` and referenced assets before
  editing files.

## Python Conventions

- Always use a Python virtual environment (`python -m venv .venv`) inside `workspace/`. Do not install packages into the global Python environment.
- Use type hints and dataclasses consistently with the existing simulation modules.
- Prefer async-safe access through `SimulationEngine` methods when API code reads or mutates building state.
- Do not bypass the engine lock for state mutations that can be reached from FastAPI routes or WebSocket updates.
- Raise clear validation errors for invalid floor numbers and same-floor passenger trips.
- Add or update `unittest` tests for dispatch, passenger validation, simulation ticks, and API-adjacent behavior when changing those areas.

## Frontend Conventions

- Keep the UI framework-free unless the user asks for a framework.
- The served JavaScript is `workspace/ui/static/main.js`. If changing TypeScript source in `workspace/ui/main.ts`, also ensure the served JavaScript stays in sync by running the TypeScript build or making the equivalent update.
- Preserve the dashboard plus live building visualization: elevator cabs, floors, shafts, waiting passenger dots, riding passenger dots, and status controls.
- Keep CSS responsive and compatible with modern desktop and mobile browsers.

## Product Requirements Documents

- Store product requirements documents in the top-level `docs/` folder.
- Name PRD files with the pattern `prd-document-name.md`, using lowercase kebab-case after the `prd-` prefix. Examples: `docs/prd-postgres-event-log.md`, `docs/prd-dashboard-analytics.md`.
- Keep PRDs implementation-oriented enough for Copilot to generate code, tests, and documentation from them, but avoid prescribing unnecessary internal details before the design is understood.
- Treat PRDs as living documents. Update acceptance criteria, risks, dependencies, and decisions when requirements change.
- Link related prompts, issues, screenshots, diagrams, or prototype assets when they materially affect the requirements.

Use this template when the user asks to create a PRD or when a feature request is broad enough to need product-level clarification:

## Technical Approach

## Validation Commands

Run commands from the `workspace/` directory with the
virtual environment activated unless noted otherwise.

```bash
python -m venv .venv          # create (first time)
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python -m compileall .
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

For UI TypeScript changes, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

To run the app locally:

```bash
python -m uvicorn api.server:app --reload --port 7000
```

## Change Discipline

- Keep changes focused on the current lab prompt or user request.
- Do not rewrite unrelated generated files or prompt files.
- Do not modify files under `completed/` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Preserve existing user or formatter edits when updating files.
- For Markdown prompts, PRDs, and documentation prose, prefer a wider wrap around 110 to 120 columns so text uses the editor width;
	avoid narrow CRLF-style wrapping unless matching an existing table, code block, or template section.
