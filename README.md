# Elevator Dispatch Application

This folder contains the runnable FastAPI and TypeScript application used by the Elevator Dispatch Workshop. It is the
hands-on code surface for the lab: participants run the app, inspect the simulation model, update behavior with Copilot,
and validate changes with repeatable commands.

## What It Does

The app simulates a 6-level building (B1 plus floors 1-5) with 4 elevators. A simple dispatcher assigns passengers to
compatible elevators, while a FastAPI backend streams live snapshots to a browser dashboard over WebSockets. When
`DATABASE_URL` is set, the app also writes simulation run metadata and passenger lifecycle events to PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

| Setup Path | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Codespaces or devcontainer | Dependencies are installed by the repository devcontainer. |
| Manual local setup | Python 3.10+, Node.js LTS, npm, and Git. |
| Optional database persistence and inspection | PostgreSQL client (`psql`) and access to the devcontainer Postgres sidecar. |

## Run Locally

Create and activate a virtual environment from this directory:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

Start the app in in-memory mode:

```bash
python -m uvicorn api.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload --port 7000
```

Start the app with PostgreSQL persistence enabled:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://elevator:elevator@postgres:5432/elevator_dispatch \
python -m uvicorn api.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload --port 7000
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:7000> to view the dashboard.

In Codespaces, open the forwarded port URL for port `7000`. If the forwarded page returns `HTTP ERROR 502`, first
check whether the app is healthy inside the container:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/state
gh codespace ports --codespace "$CODESPACE_NAME"
```

If localhost returns `200 OK`, the app is running and the 502 is usually a stale Codespaces tunnel or a one-time port
access gate. Refresh the browser tab, confirm port `7000` is forwarded, and click GitHub's **Continue** button if the
"Codespaces Access Port" warning appears. If nothing is listening on `7000`, restart `uvicorn` from `workspace/` with
the virtual environment activated.

## Verify Changes

Run these commands before handing off code changes:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
.venv/bin/python -m compileall api simulation tests
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
npm run build
```

The Python validation commands depend on packages installed in `workspace/.venv`. Running the tests with the global
Python interpreter can fail with imports such as `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic'` even when the
application itself is correctly set up.

If `npm run build` fails with `tsc: Permission denied` because the tracked TypeScript shim under `node_modules` is not
executable, temporarily restore executable bits for validation and then reset the mode-only changes before handoff:

```bash
chmod 755 node_modules/.bin/tsc node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc
npm run build
chmod 644 node_modules/.bin/tsc node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc
```

## Inspect PostgreSQL

The live simulation state remains in memory, but the app writes database rows when `DATABASE_URL` is configured. From the
repository root, inspect the schema with:

```bash
.github/skills/postgres-schema-inspection/scripts/inspect-postgres-schema.sh
```

Or from this folder, use the convenience wrapper:

```bash
scripts/inspect-postgres-schema.sh
```

Expected tables are `simulation_runs`, `passenger_events`, and `scenarios`. `simulation_runs` stores run metadata, and
`passenger_events` stores `created`, `assigned`, `boarded`, and `exited` events. Clicking **Restart simulation** calls
`POST /api/restart`, clears application table rows, and creates a fresh run row when persistence is enabled.

The PostgreSQL schema intentionally avoids optional PostgreSQL extensions. Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server
may reject `pgcrypto` unless it is allow-listed, so the application generates UUID values in Python instead of relying on
`gen_random_uuid()`.

## Azure Deployment Notes

The current Azure workshop deployment uses Azure Container Apps, Azure Container Registry, Log Analytics, a
user-assigned managed identity with `AcrPull`, and optional Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server. The deployed
workshop endpoint verified on 2026-05-13 was:

<https://ca-elevator-dispatch-dev.bluetree-41095b7a.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/>

Useful deployment checks:

```bash
azd env get-values
az containerapp revision list \
  --name ca-elevator-dispatch-dev \
  --resource-group rg-elevator-dispatch \
  --query '[].{name:name,active:properties.active,traffic:properties.trafficWeight,health:properties.healthState,replicas:properties.replicas}' \
  -o table
curl -fsS https://ca-elevator-dispatch-dev.bluetree-41095b7a.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/api/state
```

Deployment gotchas found during the Azure migration:

- `azd deploy` needs `AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT` when deploying to existing Azure resources. Set it with
  `azd env set AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT crelevatordispatchdev.azurecr.io` if the value is missing.
- Azure CLI read operations can succeed while ARM write operations are blocked by MFA policy. Refresh `azd` with
  `azd auth login --tenant-id 54d665dd-30f1-45c5-a8d5-d6ffcdb518f9` before retrying `azd deploy`.
- A `504` from Container Apps usually means traffic is on an unhealthy revision. Check revision health and console logs
  before changing ingress settings.
- `HEAD /` returns `405` because the dashboard route is a FastAPI `GET` route. Use `curl -fsS https://<app>/` for the
  dashboard smoke test.
- Terraform state files can contain generated database credentials. They are ignored by Git in this repository; never
  commit or share them, and rotate credentials if state is exposed outside the dev environment.

## Extension Points

| Area | Good Workshop Changes |
| --- | --- |
| `simulation/dispatcher.py` | Try alternative dispatch heuristics while keeping the logic easy to explain. |
| `simulation/simulation.py` | Adjust tick lifecycle, passenger spawning, pause/resume, or completion behavior. |
| `api/database.py` | Extend optional persistence helpers without making the database mandatory. |
| `api/server.py` | Add validated endpoints or API-adjacent behavior through `SimulationEngine` methods. |
| `ui/main.ts` and `ui/static/styles.css` | Extend the live dashboard while keeping served JavaScript in sync. |
| `tests/` | Add focused `unittest` coverage for simulation and dispatcher changes. |

## Notes for the Lab

- Keep live simulation state in memory; use PostgreSQL only for optional run and event persistence.
- Preserve the 6-level, 4-elevator default scenario with B1 stored as floor `-1` and displayed as `B1`.
- Prefer small, explicit modules and teachable heuristics over clever abstractions.
- When changing TypeScript source, run `npm run build` so `ui/static/main.js` stays current.
- Keep elevator cab tracks bounded to the shaft grid. If changing the dashboard layout, verify all four cabs remain
  visible in distinct shafts and that B1 is the bottom row. Avoid relying on CSS `calc()` multiplication for cab offsets;
  simple addition-based expressions are more reliable across browser contexts.
- Small color-change PR labs should touch only the targeted selector in `workspace/ui/static/styles.css`. If
  `workspace/ui/main.ts` is unchanged, `npm run build` should not rewrite `workspace/ui/static/main.js`.
